# The Decision Muscle API

## System Objective

The Decision Muscle API is a system designed to reduce decision failure
by matching responsibility to real-time capacity at the moment of
commitment.

The identified primary failure mode in humans is:

commitment--capacity mismatch at decision time

People consistently commit to actions that exceed their current
Available Action Range (AAR), which leads to execution failure, 
erosion of self-trust, and progressive reduction in perceived agency.

Decision failure is therefore not primarily motivational, but operational.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Problem Layer (Human Reality)

In real life, people typically:

-   Know what matters to them (direction exists)
-   Know where they tend to break (failure modes exist)
-   Have strengths they can rely on (capacity exists)

Yet still fail to follow through.

Common failure patterns include:

-   Committing to misaligned pursuits
-   Committing beyond current capacity
-   Choosing feasible but misaligned alternatives
-   Making decisions under depleted bandwidth
-   Interpreting execution failure as identity failure

This results in repeated:

miscalibration between responsibility and actual capacity

which degrades:

self-trust (agency) over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Mechanism Layer (System Hypothesis)

Decision failure occurs when:

Perceived Agency ≠ Actual Agency

Users tend to:

-   Overestimate their available capacity
-   Commit under emotional or contextual load
-   Ignore known personal failure patterns ("Dangers")
-   Fail to leverage currently available personal resources ("Strengths")

Which results in commitments made:

outside of their Available Action Range (AAR)

AAR represents:

the set of actions realistically executable in the current physiological and psychological state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Functional Layer (System Must Do)

If decision failure is driven by commitment--capacity mismatch, the system must:

-   Capture user direction (Identity / Value Compass)
-   Estimate current effective capacity (Agency)
-   Surface known personal risk patterns ("Dangers" or "Threats")
-   Surface currently available personal resources ("Strengths" or "Opportunities")
-   Estimate task difficulty
-   Detect overcommitment risk
-   Recommend responsibility adjustment
-   Log execution outcome
-   Track calibration error over time

The system's objective is to:

improve responsibility calibration at decision time

## 4. Component Layer (App Modules)

  | Functional Need             | Component          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Capture direction           | Identity Anchor    |
| Score alignment             | Value Compass      |
| Infer effective capacity    | Capacity Snapshot  |
| Detect active failure modes | Danger Profile     |
| Detect available resources  | Strength Profile   |
| Estimate task difficulty    | Task Input         |
| Adjust commitment           | Calibration Engine |
| Track execution             | Outcome Log        |
| Learn over time             | Agency Model       |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Core Loop

The system reduces decision failure by calibrating commitment level to actual capacity at decision time.

```
Decision
↓
Capacity Snapshot
↓
Commitment Calibration
↓
Execution
↓
Outcome
↓
Calibration Update
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

```
Identity Anchor → Value Compass
↓
Decision Context
↓
Capacity Snapshot
↓
Active Danger Check
↓
Available Strength Check
↓
Commitment Calibration
↓
Execution
↓
Outcome
↓
Agency Model Update
```

Effective Capacity (Agency) is estimated as:

Agency = Capacity Snapshot
- Active Danger Load
+ Available Strength Support
