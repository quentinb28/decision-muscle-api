# The Decision Muscle API

## 1. Problem Layer (Human Reality)

In real life, decision failure rarely comes from a lack of insight.

People typically:

-   Know what matters to them (direction exists)
-   Know where they tend to break (failure modes exist)
-   Have strengths they can rely on (capacity exists)

Yet still fail to follow through.

Common failure patterns include:

-   Committing to misaligned pursuits\
-   Committing beyond current capacity\
-   Choosing feasible but misaligned alternatives\
-   Making decisions under depleted bandwidth\
-   Interpreting execution failure as identity failure

This results in repeated:

miscalibration between responsibility and actual capacity (agency)

which degrades:

self-trust (agency) over time.

Decision failure is therefore often not motivational, but *operational*.

## 2. Mechanism Layer (System Hypothesis)

Decision failure occurs when:

Perceived Agency ≠ Actual Agency

Users tend to:

-   Overestimate their available capacity
-   Commit under emotional or contextual load
-   Ignore known personal failure patterns ("Dangers")
-   Fail to leverage currently available personal resources ("Strengths")

Which results in commitments made:

outside of their Available Action Range (AAR)

AAR represents:

the set of actions realistically executable in the current physiological and psychological state.

## 3. Functional Layer (System Must Do)

If decision failure is driven by capacity miscalibration, the system must:

-   Capture user direction (Identity / Value Compass)
-   Estimate current effective capacity (Agency)
-   Surface known personal risk patterns ("Dangers")
-   Surface currently available personal resources ("Strengths")
-   Estimate task difficulty
-   Detect overcommitment risk
-   Recommend responsibility adjustment
-   Log execution outcome
-   Track calibration error over time

The system's objective is to:

improve responsibility calibration at decision time

and progressively expand the user's Decision Muscle.

## 4. Component Layer (App Modules)

  Functional Need               Component
  ----------------------------- --------------------
  Capture direction             Identity Anchor
  Score alignment               Value Compass

  Adjust commitment             Calibration Engine
  Track execution               Outcome Log

## 5. Core Loop

The system reduces:

-   follow-through failure by calibrating commitment level to actual capacity at decision time
-   alignment failure by identifying value tensions in prospective commitments
