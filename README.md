# The Decision Muscle API

1. Problem Layer (Human Reality)

What repeatedly goes wrong in real life?

- self love
- disconnection from self
- reconnect with love within to create from our authentic self
- main problems:
    - directional component: hear the signal, tune into our inner compass and direction
    - operational component: appreciate our current capacity and adjsut responsibility accordingly
- too many distractions weaken self trust / agency
- avoiding discomfort (staying with ourselves alone) is the source of all suffering
- the deeper we go the more likely we are to connect with our Godlike nature
- people commit to misaligned pursuits (lived that)
- people commit beyond current capacity (lived that)
- people commit to feasible but misaligned alternatives (lived that)
- people interpret failure as identity failure when it's often miscalibration
- people make decisions under depleted bandwidth

2. Mechanism Layer (Your Theory)

Why does this happen?

- people wrongly estimate their actual capacity
- people wrongly estimate consequences (personal & external)
- people don't allow themselves to act in alignment (old identities)
- people don't manage to recalibrate their responsibility based on actual capacity
- Available Action Range (AAR)

3. Functional Layer (System Must Do)

If the above is true, what must the system be able to do?

- Help users see their life as an experiment
- Help users estimate their actual capacity more accurately
- Help users identity their current direction, value compass
- Help users estimate task difficulty
- Detect overcommitment risk
- Recommend responsibility adjustment
- Log calibration error over time
- Overall the app should learn what helps build their Decision Muscle

4. Component Layer (Actual App Modules)

| Functional Need     | Component          |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| infer capacity      | Capacity Snapshot  |
| capture direction   | Identity Anchor    |
| score alignment     | Value Check        |
| estimate difficulty | Task Input         |
| adjust commitment   | Calibration Engine |
| track execution     | Outcome Log        |
| learn over time     | Agency Model       |
